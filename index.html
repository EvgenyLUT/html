   </ul>
   <p>Tyrr Warriors have got their power from Sapyros — an ancient Giant who received the power of wind from Sayha before the outbreak of war between gods and Giants. <br>Tyrr Warriors follow the path of Destruction. They have become free mercenaries because of their ungovernable nature.
   </p>
   <p>They are strong and wear heavy armor. They fight mostly in the front lines, striking terror into their enemies. <br>They can increase their battle characteristics using their inner energy, they're also well-versed in any weapon. <br>Furious battle-cry given to them makes Tyrr Warriors much stronger, they can also become invincible in critical situations.

   <li>Iss</li>
   <li>Debuff</li>
   <li>Healer</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Iss Enchanters succeed in protecting their allies. They have skills inherited from Sorcerer of Dawn Leister. <br>They use such skills to empower themselves and their parties like no one else. <br>They can use auras which are somewhat similar to those which Sigel Knights use (if there are two enchanters in a party, only one of them can use auras) <br>they also combine melodies and dancing to achieve the maximal effect.
   </p>
   <p>Enchanters can help their party members change their appearance and flee from the battlefield, they can also turn their opponents into butterflies or piglets. <br>They are also good at dealing with any short-range weapon and can empower an attack or neutralize mobs in no time.

   </ul>
   <p>Yul Archers are great at hitting their targets from a long distance. <br>New crossbows help them stay at a longer distance from their potential opponents and shoot at incredible speed, and their magic quivers are always full of bolts and arrows. <br>Yul Archers’s attacks may stun the enemies. Yul Archers can also summon a serpent which doesn’t need any control and distracts the opponents.
   </p>
   <p>Yul Archers move at incredible speed and can isolate mobs which makes tanks’ task a lot easier. They can also rouse hatred among the enemies and weaken them.
